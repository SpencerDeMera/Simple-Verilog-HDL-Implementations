# Simple-HDL-Implementations
A collection of hardware design projects for the **Digilent Nexys A7-100T FPGA**. These projects demonstrate fundamental FPGA concepts, focusing on synchronous design patterns and hardware interfacing.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. Basic LED Blink (Toggle Pattern)
* **Description:** A simplified 1Hz LED blinker that uses a counter to directly toggle the output state.
* **Key Concept:**
   * * **State Toggling:** Combines timing and output logic into a single block. 
   * **Standalone Design:** Specifically built for driving a single LED. Since the signal is high for 1 second, it is not reusable for driving other synchronous logic components.
* **Source:** `led_blink_1hz.v`

### 1. 1Hz LED Blink (Enable Generator Pattern)
* **Description:** A synchronous blinker that toggles an LED at 1Hz.
* **Key Concept:** Demonstrates the use of an **Enable Generator** rather than a clock divider. This ensures the entire design stays on the 100MHz global clock tree, preventing clock skew and timing violations common in "ripple clock" designs.
* **Source:** `led_blink_1hz_enGen.v`

### 2. BCD 7-Segment Counter
* **Description:** A decimal counter (0-9) that increments every second and displays the value on the seven-segment display.
* **Key Concept:**
   * **BCD Logic:** Uses a Binary Coded Decimal counter that resets at 9 rather than 15.
   * **Hardware Interfacing:** Features a combinational decoder to drive the active-low segments of the Nexys A7.
   * **Resource Management:** Drives the 8-digit anode bus to enable only the targeted display digit.
* **Source:** `BCD_7Seg.v`
